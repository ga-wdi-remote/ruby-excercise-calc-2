Day 1: Tip Calculator
We all know the struggles that come at the end of a delicious meal when dining out. Splitting the bill. Luckily for you and your poss√©, you're a brilliant developer that can create an application that allows you to split the bill, WITH TIP!

You can't wait to demonstrate your prowess, so you bust out your brand new Macbook in the middle of a 3-star Michelin restaurant, open up Atom, and begin to code in your `main.rb`.

Your calculator will ask for 4 inputs:
1. The subtotal
2. # of people
3. Give an option of how much tip to leave
4. % tax

After you input these 3 in the calculator, the calculator should take those inputs into a mathematical calculation and give our total and how much each person pays. 

Remember that tax and tip is based off the subtotal!


Day 2: Calculator
After looking like a stud and wow-ing your friends at last nights dinner's festivities, you realized that your app is not readable and reuseable at all and decide to get to work to break your app down to different files. Make 3 classes, `tip`, `tax`, and `calculator` in three different .rb files to seperate your tip calculator logic. 

Your `main.rb` file should require these three files. 

[Bonus]
You realize you have a FUEGO date that night and your date hates insects, so you want to SPICE up your app make it BUG proof before then. 

- Add regular expressions to make sure users can only put in the correct data
- Make your calculator loop so we can use it multiple times
- Change taxes to user input, to generating taxes based off the state they are located in
